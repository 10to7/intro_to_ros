Repository of packages and info for the SV-ROS Intro To ROS training series

This repo will contain the software and documents for the SV-ROS 2015 Intro to Ros training series.

The series involes a set of talks presenting a general introduction to ROS and building ROS Robots.

Reference Robot designs are provided as a guide to getting started.

The first of these is a robot built on the Neato BV80 base and using a Rasperry PI II SBC.

The ROS packages and drivers for this robot can be found in the bv80bot folder(s).

The driver is based on a modified Neato Driver first created by Michael Ferguson.
